### To Marinate the Chicken

- 1 Tsp Turmeric Powder
- 1 Tsp Kashmiri Mirch
- 1 Tsp Red Chili Powder
- 1 Tsp Coriander Powder
- 1 Tsp Cumin Powder

## Marination Process

1. Combine all listed ingredients above.

2. Mix well, ensuring each piece is well coated with the marinade.

3. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.

## Cooking Process

1. Heat **Mustard Oil** with **Ghee** and a teaspoon of sugar.
2. Once the sugar caramelizes, add **2 Bay leaves** and add the **crushed Garam Masala**.
3. An aroma will soon release; upon this, add the **Asafetida** soaked in water.
4. Mix well and add 1.5 tsp of **Ginger Paste**.
5. Let it sit over the heat and add a little water.
6. Add the **marinated mutton** and pour water in the leftover marinade, placing it aside.
7. Cook the meat and mix with the marinade until the oil starts to separate. When this occurs, transfer everything in the pan to a pressure cooker and incorporate the marinade water.
8. Shut the lid, allowing the mutton to cook until tender. Check the cooker every so often to make sure it is tender
9. Once the chicken becomes tender, transfer it to a skillet, adding **salt** and **Ghee** to taste. Top off with **Garam Masala powder**.
